Created an Excel dashboard using advanced functions to analyze the store's sales data. The key insights derived from this dashboard include a sales and order comparison, where March had the highest sales and orders, with consistent peak growth observed in that month. Customer demographics indicate that women contributed more to sales than men. The dashboard also displays order status, identifies the top 5 contributing states, and highlights the best channels for sales. Based on these insights, my recommendations are to focus marketing efforts on women, enhance presence on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart, target top-performing states, optimize order fulfillment, analyze best-selling categories, and leverage data for future predictions. This dashboard targets high-performing areas, optimizes marketing efforts, and aims to boost customer satisfaction.
